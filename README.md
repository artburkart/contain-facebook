# Hulu Container

**Prevent Hulu from tracking your visits to other websites**

Hulu Container is an add-on you can install on Firefox to prevent Hulu from tracking your activity on other websites, so you can continue to use Hulu while protecting your privacy.

**Note:** To learn more about Containers in general, see [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers).

## How does Hulu Container work?

The Add-on keeps Hulu in a separate Container to prevent it from following your activity on other websites. When you first install the add-on, it signs you out of Hulu and deletes the cookies that Hulu uses to track you on other websites. 

Every time you visit Hulu, it will open in its own container, separate from other websites you visit.  You can login to Hulu within its container.  When browsing outside the container, Hulu won’t be able to easily collect your browsing data and connect it to your Hulu identity.

## How do I enable Hulu Container?

We’ve made it easy to take steps to protect your privacy so you can go on with your day.

1. [Install Hulu Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/hulu-container/). This will log you out of Hulu and delete the cookies it’s been using to track you.
2. Open Hulu and use it like you normally would.  Firefox will automatically switch to the Hulu Container tab for you.
3. If you click on a link to a page outside of Hulu or type in another website in the address bar, Firefox will load them outside of the Hulu Container

## How does this affect Hulu’s features?

Hulu Containers prevents Hulu from linking your activity on other websites to your Hulu identity. Therefore, the following will not work:

### “Like” buttons and embedded Hulu comments on other websites.

Because you are logged into Hulu only in the Container, “Like” buttons and embedded Hulu comments on other websites will not work.

### Logging in or creating accounts on other websites using Hulu

Websites that allow you to create an account or log in using Hulu will generally not work properly.

## Will this protect me from Hulu completely?

This add-on does not prevent Hulu from mishandling the data it already has or permitted others to obtain about you. Hulu still will have access to everything that you do while you are on hulu.com or on the Hulu app, including your Hulu comments, likes, and any data you share with Hulu connected apps, etc.  

Other ad networks may try to link your Hulu activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this add-on, there are other things you can do to maximize your protection, including changing your Hulu settings, using Private Browsing and Tracking Protection, blocking third-party cookies, and/or using [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/ ) extension to further limit tracking.

## How do I use Containers for other websites?

Good news! Containers aren’t just for Hulu. You can use Containers to prevent websites from linking your identities across the Web by installing [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/).
